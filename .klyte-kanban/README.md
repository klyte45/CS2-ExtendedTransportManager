# Task project workspace  - Klyte Kanban CLI format

This folder is used to organize all actionable improvement tasks to be done on the project.

Use the `npx kk` CLI tool to manage tasks, sprints, and workspace metadata.

## Project description and notes

This folder contains the taskboard for eXtended Transport Manager mod for Cities: Skylines 2. Future features studies, design docs, and research notes should be placed in the `RefsLibrary/` subfolder. Tasks can refer them as needed via relative paths.

### Building the project

The project can be built using the command line with MSBuild:

```bash
    MSBuild.exe BelzontTLM.sln /p:Configuration=Debug 
```

It will run frontend and backends builds, and also copy the mod files into the game mods folder for testing.

### Self identification e-mail

Shall be an address hosted at @kwyt.com.br. Example: `user@kwyt.com.br`

If you are an AI agent, use your engine name and version as the local part (before the @) to help identify the source of task updates in email notifications.

### After ending a sprint

Additionally to the usual workflow via `npx kk`, manual testing will be required. So every sprint should end with a testing plan to be run by QA, and the results should be documented in the task files and/or in the `RefsLibrary/` as needed.

### `RefsLibrary/` usage guidelines

When adding a new research conetent here, always name the folder that holds all the related files with the pattern `YYYYMMDDHH_descriptive-title/` to ensure chronological ordering and easy reference from tasks. For example, `2024061509_mod-architecture-research/`.

The subfolder `_auxFiles/` contains shared auxiliary files that can help with the research, like the current game decompiled code and other reference materials. These files **cannot** be referenced directly from tasks, but can be used as a source for information to be included in the task files themselves.

### Changelog file formatting

The `changelog.md` file should follow the following format:

```markdown
# vX.Y.ZrW (DD-MMM-YY)
- Behavior change 1
- Behavior change 2
- New feature 1
- New feature 2
- Bug fix 1
- Bug fix 2

## Folder structure

### ActiveSprint/

Tasks currently being worked on in the active sprint. Each task is a markdown file following the naming convention described below.

### Backlog/

Tasks not yet scheduled for a sprint. Organized by priority and status.

### Archive/

Completed or cancelled tasks moved here at the end of each sprint.

### RefsLibrary/

Reference documents, research notes, and design decisions related to the project.

## Task file naming convention

```
X[_epic]_N_AAAA_resume-of-task.md
```

- `X`     — Status letter (see table below)
- `epic`  — Optional epic label: 3-15 lowercase alphanumeric characters
- `N`     — Priority digit: 0 (Very High) - 4 (Very Low)
- `AAAA`  — Unique sequential ID, 4+ zero-padded digits
- `title` — kebab-case description

## Task status reference

| Status | Location | Meaning | Terminal? |
|--------|----------|---------|-----------|
| `N` | Backlog or ActiveSprint | **New** — defined, has DoD, ready to be picked up | No |
| `P` | ActiveSprint | **In Progress** — actively being worked on | No |
| `T` | ActiveSprint → Archive | **Terminated/Completed** — work finished and validated | Yes |
| `Z` | ActiveSprint → Archive | **Cancelled** — abandoned during a sprint | Yes |
| `O` | Archive | **Overflown** — was in-progress when sprint closed; continuation in Backlog | Yes |
| `U` | Archive | **Uninitialized** — never started when sprint closed; continuation in Backlog | Yes |
| `D` | Backlog | **Draft** — still being defined; not ready for a sprint | No |
| `H` | Backlog | **Hold** — intentionally paused, not being actively worked on | No |
| `L` | Backlog | **Left for Later** — ready but intentionally excluded from the next sprint | No |
| `C` | Backlog | **Cancelled** — abandoned before ever reaching a sprint | Yes |

## Status flow — Backlog

    direction LR
    [*] --> D : task created (draft)
    [*] --> N : task created (ready)
    [*] --> H : task created (on hold)
    [*] --> L : task created (deferred)
    D --> N : defined & ready
    D --> H : put on hold
    D --> L : defer for later
    D --> C : cancel
    N --> L : defer for later
    N --> H : put on hold

    L --> H : hold
    L --> D : needs redefinition
    L --> C : cancel
    H --> N : resume
    H --> L : defer
    H --> D : needs redefinition
    H --> C : cancel
    C --> [*]
    note right of N : sprint init moves all N<BR/>tasks to ActiveSprint
```

## Status flow — Active Sprint

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    [*] --> N : moved from Backlog at sprint init
    N --> P : work started (Developed by required)
    N --> Z : cancelled before start
    P --> N : paused / handed back
    P --> T : completed (Developed by required)
    P --> Z : cancelled mid-work
    T --> [*]
    Z --> [*]
    note right of T : sprint close moves T and Z<BR/>to Archive/Sprint_NNN/
    note right of P : unfinished P tasks become O<BR/>(Overflown) on sprint close<BR/>and a new N task is created in Backlog
    note right of N : unstarted N tasks become U<BR/>(Uninitialized) on sprint close<BR/>and a new N task is created in Backlog
```

## `kk task update` — JSON to CLI flag mapping

When using `kk task update <id> --from-json <file>`, the JSON fields map to individual CLI flags as shown below.
Run `kk schema task` to see the full JSON schema.

|------------|----------|---------|
| `background` | `--background <text>` | `--background "Context info"` |
