# v0.1.4r4 (18-MAR-25)
- Fixes for 1.2.5 (CS1 10th anniversary) patch
- Improved behavior of the distinations blinds: now it switches to next stop when vehcile start boarding at the stop - it was when the vehicle left the previous stop, causing strange situations specially on 2-stop lines.
  - NOTICE: The behavior above won't apply to dummy traffic (for now)
