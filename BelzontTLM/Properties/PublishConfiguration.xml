  <LongDescription># Extended Transport Manager
## _A better view of public transport_

This is successor from both Transport Lines Manager (TLM) and Improved Transport Manager (ITM) from CS1. 

The overall idea is bring some tools to better manage and visualize the public transport of the city.

## How to find the mod screen

If using single monitor, use the [EUIS](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/74151/Windows) mod shortcut to open the main screen overlay over the game screen, then find this mod icon in the taskbar. By default, it's `Ctrl+Tab`.

When using multiple monitors, it may be visible in any of them, except if disabled at EUIS settings screen.

## For Write Everywhere users! *(new at 0.1.4)*

Now you can edit dynamic blinds for each line:
	- Add multiple keyframes and setup how many frames it shall be shown in game. Each keyframe can show a destination, the line name/number or a fixed text
	- Select one of the keyframes to be used when a static destination blind is used (may be useful in future for classic custom vehicles)
	- Add multiple steps! Each step will be used until before the selected stop (or end of the line). Each step may have one or more keyframes.

By default, XTM creates two steps each line with two keyframes: Line number and the selected stop for that step end. The steps will target the stop at middle of the line *(n ï¿½ 2)* and the end of the line.
