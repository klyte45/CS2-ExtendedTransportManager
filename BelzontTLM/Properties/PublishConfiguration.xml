  <LongDescription># Extended Transport Manager
## _A better view of public transport_

This is successor from both Transport Lines Manager (TLM) and Improved Transport Manager (ITM) from CS1. 

The overall idea is bring some tools to better manage and visualize the public transport of the city.

## How to find the mod screen

If using single monitor, use the [EUIS](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/74151/Windows) mod shortcut to open the main screen overlay over the game screen, then find this mod icon in the taskbar. By default, it's `Ctrl+Tab`.

When using multiple monitors, it may be visible in any of them, except if disabled at EUIS settings screen.

## Current features

- Auto color - import palettes to the city then apply to transport type
  - 20+ default palletes included.
  - Create your own palettes using the game UI
  - Palettes can be grouped in "folders" to organize better your library
  - Palettes used in the city are now saved along them. No more issues if changing the global palettes!
- Line listing - Very simple by now, might be improved in the future
- Detailed linear map - View detailed info about stops, vehicles and also transport integrations
- Customize line naming - You can use the game name pattern to use the route identifier as you wish, using any kind of characters
- Lines shields - like it was in TLM:
  - Hexagon for buses
  - Trapeze for trams
  - Square for metro
  - Circle for passenger trains
  - Diamond for passenger ships
  - Pentagon for passenger airplanes
  - Octogon for freight trains (NEW)
